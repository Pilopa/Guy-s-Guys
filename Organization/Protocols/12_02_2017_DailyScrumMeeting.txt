Recap of the procedure of this meeting.
Burn down chart backwards-adjusted, in reaction to a miscommunication between Tiberiu and the Scrum Master (Konstantin). See Commit ad7b635.
Alex has got a dependency problem, as he needs to wait until the database has been set up.
Burndown chart backwards-adjusted, in reaction to a misscomunication between Philip and the Scrum Master (Konstantin). See Commit 9a8f8bc.
The group decided to update the burndown chart at every meeting, in contrast to updating it as they finish work.
Everyone except Ned, who was not able to attend, has work to do and no unanswered dependencies until the next meeting.
The next meeting is going to take place on Tuesday 14/02/2017 3:00pm.

Konstantin, as Scrum Master and Leader, was taken into consideration for the calculation of the initial capacity, although not strongly participating in the completion of the actual tasks.
The team decided to ignore this fact for the remainder of the sprint and adjust the schedule for the next sprint accordingly instead.

Tasks created:
- Setup the Database (0-2 hours)
- Gather what info the product owner would like displayed. (0-2)
- Gather the information for the database. (0-2)
