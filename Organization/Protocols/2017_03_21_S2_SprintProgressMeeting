Attended: Ned, Konstantin
Start: 3:35pm
Finish: 

The sprint failed and no work has been done. The team's velocity for this sprint has been zero.
The plans to improve this sprint (See 2017_02_28_SprintReviewMeeting) did not have any effect on the outcome of this sprint, therefore new solutions have to be found.

The core problem identified as a result of the last two sprints is:
Tasks are not being executed, even though they are at least averagely well planned and communicated.

Solution:
One additional person (Konstantin) is assigned the role of a programmer, so the main workload can be finished by more people.
This will increase the teams capacity by 3 hours per week as well, as Konstantin previously was not counted into the capacity, because he only had the Scrum Master role.

The current sprint backlog and the burndown chart showed, that we would not be able to successfully finish the sprint right now.
Hence we will add an additional week of work to this sprint and push all other sprints back by a week.
