Agenda:
1. Capacity Estimation
2. Move unfinished user stories and tasks back to product backlog
3. Choose user stories
4. Create tasks
5. Estimate tasks

Because of the enrichment week took place and was not taken into account, the team has to decide to either make a two weeks sprint (2. sprint) or push back all sprints by a full week to compensate for the time loss.

Result: The team decided to do a two weeks sprint (2. sprint), starting today 07/03/2017, and then continue with 2 more three weeks sprints (3. and 4. sprint) to have more buffer time at the end.


1. Capacity Estimation

As described in "2017_02_28_SprintReviewMeeting", the team is capable of doing 3 hours of work per week per person, excluding the scrum master, which leads to a capacity of 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 hours for this sprint.

2. Done
3. The team decided to do the user stories: "Users can log in to the system." and "Users can browse and look into membership information."
4. Done:
From now on, tasks will have metrics attached to them which determine when it can be considered finished.
5. Done:
The combined workload for the sprint is 25 hours. Even though one hour more than the capacity, the team decided to do the sprint as is.
