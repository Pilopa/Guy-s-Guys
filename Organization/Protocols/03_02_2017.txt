Skype Meeting
Start: 18:15pm
Finish: 19:30pm
Attended: Alex, Ned, Konstantin, Tiberiu
Alex Bristow entered the team as a fifth member and has been informed about previous decisions made by the team before his entry.
The team decided to reassign the roles within the team (instead of just assigning roles to alex that had already been assigned to somebody else aswell) on a different meeting, because one of the team members is missing.
The team decided to use trello as the main tool to maintain user stories and the progress of the scrum procedure (https://trello.com/guysguys).
The draft portion of the product backlog is open for team members to fill with user stories until the next meeting (https://trello.com/b/TtoOSxSt/product-backlog).
The next meeting is going to be scheduled on Tuesday (07/02) 11:30am in person at the Solent Library. Topics are going to be: roles distribution and preliminary user stories
