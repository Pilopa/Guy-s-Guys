Attended: Philip, Konstantin, Ned
Start: 3:15pm
Finish: 3:53pm (Actual Daily Scrum: 3:30pm)

Discussion about programming language has arisen. Communication between programmers and/or software architects will be necessary.

Ned still doesn't have tasks assigned, but needs to contact Tiberiu first to solve the question mentioned first in this document.

Tasks need to be assigned specific output (files) in the future.

Decision to be made for the current sprint:
1. Kill the sprint and do a two weeks mini sprint afterwards; team is not complete though and new sprint would start on bad terms, just as this one did.
2. Continue as is and use the experience and metrics to improve the next sprint
3. Remove user stories (and connected tasks), that cannot be completed, immediately; Invalidates the metrics generated by the burndown chart

The team (who attended the meeting) decided to take the second option, continue as is and fix all arisen issues in the meetings at the end of the sprint (retrospect/review). The tasks should be finished in order of the priority of the user stories.

The team is still happy with trello.

The preliminary date for the next meeting is: Sunday 19/02/2017, 7:45pm.
