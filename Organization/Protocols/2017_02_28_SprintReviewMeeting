Topics & Solution:

! The sprint failed !

1. Time Estimation (Overestimated the capacity and took scrum master into account when calculating it)

1.1 Each Team member should invest more hours each week (as much as actually planned).

  The work investment per person per week is going to be reduced to 3 hours (to better fit the actual work done per week as   visible in the burndown chart).
  The scrum master is no longer taken into account when calculating the workload capacity.
  
  Because the sprint failed, the velocity value is not going to be used as the capacity for the second sprint, 
  but a new initial capacity is going to be calculated instead.

1.2 Motivate each other more to reach the required amount of hours per week.
1.3 Improve the time estimation process.

  Categories were too big. The time was estimated based on the top end of each category, which was misleading for some tasks.
  New time estimation categories:
  up to 1 < 2 < 3 < 5 < 8+
  
  Tasks that are bigger than 8 hours should be broken down into multiple smaller tasks.

1.4 Improve task distribution.

  Programmers are doing the bulky tasks.
  Outsource as much of the programmer's work to other team members as possible.

2. Sprint Failed (User Stories incomplete)

  Move unfinished user stories and tasks back to temporary section in the backlog.
  Reprioritize user stories.
  Basically redo as much of the first sprint as possible after calculating the capacity.
  
3. Tasks are too ambiguous

  Create a more detailed description for each task.
